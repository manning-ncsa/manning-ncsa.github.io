OCPS Job Manager API
============================================

The OCSP Job Manager API spec is documented using the `OpenAPI <https://swagger.io/specification/>`_ format: :download:`ocps_job_manager.openapi.yaml.js`. 

Browse the `API spec using the Swagger UI <spec.html>`_.

The API spec development may be ahead of what is implemented in the API server.

.. note::
    In order to allow the API spec to render in the Swagger UI entirely in the browser without running a webserver, the OpenAPI spec YAML is "wrapped" in a JavaScript template literal variable definition. To edit this more easily, you will want to manually set your editor's syntax interpreter to YAML instead of the JavaScript it will automatically try based on the file extension.
